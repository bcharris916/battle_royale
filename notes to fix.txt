1) Parent class for AnimBP
2) Parent class for unit (done but not tested. the basic functionality currently works)
3) Place more weight on the controller than you do the unit. The unit is a puppet. The controller makes all descisions.
4) Consider a swapping mechanism for weapons. 3 sockets, LH, RH, BACK and weapons are only picked up if required hands are empty. Therefore you will also need a drop function.
