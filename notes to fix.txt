1) Parent class for AnimBP
	created but unimplemented... you will remove all things that are specific to dwarf but keep all that are generally true.
2) Parent class for unit (done but not tested. the basic functionality currently works)
3) Place more weight on the controller than you do the unit. The unit is a puppet. The controller makes all descisions.
4) Consider a swapping mechanism for weapons. 3 sockets, LH, RH, BACK and weapons are only picked up if required hands are empty. Therefore you will also need a drop function.

Future goals.

1) Level ups 
2) XP
3) Better AI for enemies
	Attacking as a group
	intercepting rather than following (math I can show you)
